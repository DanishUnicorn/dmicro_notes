  abstract = {Culturalable and non-culturable microorganisms naturally ferment majority of global fermented foods and beverages. Traditional food fermentation represents an extremely valuable cultural heritage in most regions, and harbors a huge genetic potential of valuable but hitherto undiscovered strains. Holistic approaches for identification and complete profiling of both culturalable and non-culturable microorganisms in global fermented foods are of interest to food microbiologists. The application of culture -independent technique has thrown new light on the diversity of a number of hitherto unknown and non -cultural microorganisms in naturally fermented foods. Functional bacterial groups ("phylotypes") may be reflected by their mRNA expression in a particular substrate and not by mere DNA -level detection. An attempt has been made to review the microbiology of some fermented foods and alcoholic beverages of the world.},

In addition, new tools for microbial genome analysis and new flowcharts that complement the didactic elements have been added. Exercises and training questionnaires are included at the end of each chapter to facilitate learning. The book is aimed at Ph.D. students and advanced undergraduate students in microbiology, biotechnology, and (veterinary) medicine with little or basic knowledge of bioinformatics.},

abstract = {Lactic acid fermentation is considered a technological option to preserve and/or improve the safety, nutritional, sensory, and shelf life features of vegetables and fruits. The autochthonous microbiota may cause the spontaneous fermentation of several vegetables. In raw vegetables and fruits, lactic acid fermentation may occur spontaneously, when anaerobic conditions, water activity, moisture, salt concentration, and temperature are favorable for the growth of the autochthonous lactic acid bacteria. The main fermented vegetable products include sauerkrauts, kimchi, and pickled cucumbers. Raw fruits and some vegetables possess intrinsic chemical and physical parameters that make them particularly hostile environments for microorganisms. Phenolic compounds are secondary plant metabolites widely spread throughout the plant kingdom. These food components have attracted interest because of their health benefits. The chapter also presents a brief note on the novel probiotics candidates.},

They target gastrointestinal effects via the gut, although direct application to other sites such as the oral cavity, vaginal tract and skin is being explored. Here, we describe gut-derived effects in humans. In the past decade, research on the gut microbiome has rapidly accumulated and has been accompanied by increased interest in probiotics and prebiotics as a means to modulate the gut microbiota. Given the importance of these approaches for public health, it is timely to reiterate factual and supporting information on their clinical application and use. In this Review, we discuss scientific evidence on probiotics and prebiotics, including mechanistic insights into health effects. Strains of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Saccharomyces have a long history of safe and effective use as probiotics, but Roseburia spp., Akkermansia spp., Propionibacterium spp. and Faecalibacterium spp. show promise for the future. For prebiotics, glucans and fructans are well proven, and evidence is building on the prebiotic effects of other substances (for example, oligomers of mannose, glucose, xylose, pectin, starches, human milk and polyphenols).}

abstract = {Abstract Fermentation has been used for preserving foods for centuries prior to the invention of pasteurization and sterilization, and every culture has a variety of fermented products as part of its diet. This paper reviews the diversity of fermented foods and beverages from Latin America; these fermented products are produced by traditional methods that exploit mixed cultures of various nonpathogenic microorganisms. Fermented foods covered in this review include maize, cassava, palm sap, sugar cane juice, cocoa, and milk. We explore the history of some Colombian fermented foods and beverages, which are today part of the tradition of some ethnic groups, and evaluate their technology, microbiology, the presence of some nutritional factors, and safety concerns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the 1st systematic review on Colombian fermented beverages and foods, and we believe that it may contribute to valorize these products that are still part of the Latin America tradition.},
