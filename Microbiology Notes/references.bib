  abstract = {Microbial communities of fermented foods have provided humans with tools for preservation and flavor development for thousands of years. These simple, reproducible, accessible, culturable, and easy-to-manipulate systems also provide opportunities for dissecting the mechanisms of microbial community formation. Fermented foods can be valuable models for processes in less tractable microbiota.}

  abstract = {Culturalable and non-culturable microorganisms naturally ferment majority of global fermented foods and beverages. Traditional food fermentation represents an extremely valuable cultural heritage in most regions, and harbors a huge genetic potential of valuable but hitherto undiscovered strains. Holistic approaches for identification and complete profiling of both culturalable and non-culturable microorganisms in global fermented foods are of interest to food microbiologists. The application of culture -independent technique has thrown new light on the diversity of a number of hitherto unknown and non -cultural microorganisms in naturally fermented foods. Functional bacterial groups ("phylotypes") may be reflected by their mRNA expression in a particular substrate and not by mere DNA -level detection. An attempt has been made to review the microbiology of some fermented foods and alcoholic beverages of the world.},

@book{L3-SeqBasedClass,
  abstract = {This updated and extended second edition of the textbook introduces the basic concepts of bioinformatics and enhances students' skills in the use of software and tools relevant to microbiology research. It discusses the most relevant methods for analysing data and teaches readers how to draw valid conclusions from the observations obtained. Free software and servers available on the Internet are presented in an updated version of 2023 and more advanced stand-alone software is proposed as a second option. In addition, new tools for microbial genome analysis and new flowcharts that complement the didactic elements have been added. Exercises and training questionnaires are included at the end of each chapter to facilitate learning. The book is aimed at Ph.D. students and advanced undergraduate students in microbiology, biotechnology, and (veterinary) medicine with little or basic knowledge of bioinformatics.},
