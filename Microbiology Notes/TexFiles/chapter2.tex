\section{04.09.24 - Microscope}

\subsection{Parts of the microscope}
The Microscope is put together by different components, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:MicroscopeComponents}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Figures/MicroscopeComponents.png}
    \caption{The different components of a microscope.}
    \label{fig:MicroscopeComponents}
\end{figure}

The main components are: 
\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Ocular
        \subitem This is the set of lenses that you peer into, when you use a microscope. The “only” purpose of this part is to relay the intermediate image created by the objective to the retina of our eyes, i.e. to make us see an image. The ocular also magnifies the intermediate image with the factor of the ocular (usually around 10x); however, increasing the magnification of the ocular does not increase the resolving power (finer details of the specimen will not be 
        revealed)

        \vspace{5pt}\hrule\vspace{5pt}

        \item Objective
        \subitem Resolves the structure of the specimen, creating an intermediate image inside the microscope. The image is magnified with the factor depicted on the objective (often 10X, 40X and 100X). The objectives can be changed by rotating the objective turret, but this must be done cautiously to avoid mechanical damage. Objectives fitted for phase contrast will also be labelled with the size of the phase ring (usually this is depicted on the objective as either PH1, PH2 or PH3)

\end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Microscope stage
        \subitem The (translation) microscope stage holds the specimen firmly with a specimen holder, and allows the specimen to be moved in fine increments in two dimensions

        \vspace{5pt}\hrule\vspace{5pt}

        \item Condenser
        \subitem * The condenser is located underneath the
        microscope stage. The purpose of this optical part is to illuminate our specimen optimally
        
        \subitem * Our microscopes for microbiological work have a condenser with a rotating turret that enables the use of phase contrast imaging, as a specific annular ring in this turret must be matched with the size of the phase ring in the objective. There is a cut-out on the front of the turret that depict the actual selection. In this picture the Ph2 ring has been selected
    
        \subitem * Apart from the phase rings, the turret also includes a blank opening that allows for traditional brightfield observation depicted with a 0, and a setting for darkfield depicted with a DF

    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\subsection{Contrast methods}

\subsubsection*{Brightfield}
This simply magnifies the specimen. However it is almost impossible to see cells, without a staining procedure, that selectively  stains parts of the cells. Quite often, a stained specimen is also fixed, which means that the cells have been killed, so for live specimens (e.g. live bacteria), we need a different contrast method.

\subsubsection*{Darkfield}
This is only useful for 10X objectives or smaller, so for 
observing virtually all living cells.

\subsubsection*{Phase contrast}
This is the best method. The theory behind phase contrast is a little complicated (but hey - the guy won the Nobel Prize), but you can utilize phase contrast without knowing the theory. All you have to remember is:

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The number on the phase objective and the number on the condenser turret must match to obtain a proper image (e.g. Ph 2 for the 40 x objective)
        \item The Field diaphragm in the bottom of the microscope should be completely open
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\subsection{How to use the microscope}

\subsubsection*{Preparing the microscope}
Set the ocular distance to match YOUR interpupillary distance; The distance between the eyes of people differs a lot. Our microscopes are equipped with two eyepieces, in order for you to look down the microscope in the same way as you look through a binocular, and ultimately the same way as you look on the world as such. Therefore, the first thing to do when you approach a microscope is to adjust the ocular distance to your individual interpupillary distance. The ocular distance can be read on a mm-scale (commonly 50-75) between the oculars.

The interpupillary distance is extremely easy to obtain, because you simply ask a friend to measure the distance between your pupils with an ordinary ruler. Memorise this value (because it is the same for the rest of your life), and adjust the oculars to your distance before you do anything else. This increases the comfort of using a microscope tremendously.

\section{04.09.24 - Yeast: Cytology, taxonomy and physiology}

\subsection{Background}
Yeast are quite different from bacterias, first of all, they are bigger than bacterias. Yeast are also eukaryotic, which means that they have a nucleus, and they have a lot of organelles. The yeast \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiase} has a pair of 16 chromosomes, which is quite a lot for a yeast and thus making it a non-haploid.
The many differences from bacteria will influence their identification, their growth characteristics as well as the interactions with the food matrix. Proper identfication of yeast is therefore important for the correct use of starter cultures as well as for spoilage yeasts.

\subsection{Eukaryotes}

Since yeast are Eukaryotes, here are some key features of Eukaryotes:
\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Eukaryotes contain far more DNA than prokaryotes (x 100-1000). Yeast genome sizes
        range from 10-15 Mb and encode 5000-10000 genes
        \item The DNA is organised in a number of chromosomes
        \item The chromosomes are organised in a nucleus
        \item The presence of mitochondria
        \item The presence of different organelles such as: the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic
        reticulum
        \item Besides partly being involved in killer toxin production, the function of plasmids in
        yeasts is not really known
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\subsection{Organelles}

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{CW: Cell wall (physical protection, adhesion etc.)}
        \item P: Periplasm
        \item \textbf{CM: Plasma membrane (transport in/out of the cytoplasma)}
        \item CMI: Invagination
        \item BS: Bud scar
        \item C: Cytoplasm
        \item \textbf{N: Nucleus (DNA in chromosomes)}
        \item \textbf{M: Mitochondrion (ATP synthesis, enzymes)}
        \item S: Secretory vesicles
        \item \textbf{V: Vacuole (protein trafficking, storage)}
        \item PER: Peroxisome
        \item ER: Endoplasmic reticulum
        \item G: Golgi apparatus
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

In this course, we will focus on the cell wall, the plasma membrane, the nucleus, the mitochondrion and the vacuole. Though the other listed organelles are important, they are not as important for the physiology of yeast.

\subsubsection*{Cell wall}
The cell wall gives the yeast physical protection against the environment. It also maintains the shape of the yeast cell, and it is important for the osmotic stability of the yeast cell. The cell wall also has permeability barriers, which means that solutes larger than 620-760 Da can not pass the cell wall. The cell wall also has enzyme support, cation binding, cell-cell recognition and adhesion to other surfaces.

\subsubsection*{Plasma membrane}
The primary functions of the yeast plasma membrane are to dictate what enters and what leaves the cytoplasma i.e. to be a primary barrier for passage of hydrophilic molecules and prevent cytoplasmic contents to mix with the environment. The plasma membrane is also important for the uptake of nutrients, the excretion of waste products, the maintenance of the cell shape and the cell wall, and the cell division.

\subsubsection*{Nucleus}

\subsection{Methodologies for species identification of yeast} 
There are various methods for species identification of yeast, including:
\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Micro- and macromorphological identification added phenotypic characterisation
        \item Sequencing of the D1/D2 domain of the 26S rRNA gene (> 99\% homology = belong to the same species)
        \item Sequencing of multiple genes
        \item Sequencing of the ITS region (mostly moulds and yeasts identified by metagenomics)
        \item Identification of protein patterns by MALDI-TOF MS
        \item Analysis of biomas by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
        \item Others...
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\subsection{Yeast taxonomy}
The taxonomy of yeast is quite complex, but it is important to know the different levels of taxonomy. The taxonomy of yeast is as follows:
\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Kingdom: Fungi (Both yeast and moulds are fungi)
        \item \textbf{Phylum:} e.g Ascomycota // Basidiomycota
        \item \textbf{Class:} e.g \textit{Saccharomycetes}
        \item \textbf{Order:} e.g \textit{Saccharomycetales}
        \item Family: e.g \textit{Saccharomycetaceae}
        \item Genus: e.g \textit{Saccharomyces}
        \item Species: e.g \textit{Saccharomyces 
        cerevisiae}    

    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

The following is not universally recognized, but are used in some contexts:
\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Subspecies: e.g \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} subsp. \textit{cerevisiae}
        \item Variety: e.g \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} var. \textit{cerevisiae}
        \item Strain: e.g \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} subsp. \textit{cerevisiae} strain \textit{S288C}
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\subsection{Substrates for yeasts}
Following are some examples of some substrates which are greatly used for the propagation of yeasts:

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Malt yeast extract Glucose Peptone agar (MYGP)
        \item Yeast extract Peptone Glucose (YPG) agar
        \item Malt Agar (MA)
        \item Lysine agar a.o. (for non-Saccharomyces yeasts)
        \item WLN medium (allows separation by coloration)
        \item Others\dots
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

There are som stress tolerant yeasts where high concentrations of substrates are needed in the media for the growth of specific yeast. Some examples of medias for stress tolerant yeasts can be seen in \ref{fig:StressTolerantYeasts}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering

        \subitem Growth on 50\% glucose-yeast extract agar
        \subitem Etc.
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\subsection{Macro-morphological characteristics}
There are many different macro-morphological characteristics of yeast, some of the ones we will be using in this course laboratory exercises can be seen in figure \ref{fig:Macromorp}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \rotatebox{90}{\includegraphics[width=0.55\textwidth]{Figures/Macromorph.JPG}}
    \caption{Examples of macro-morphological characteristics of yeast that will be evaluated in the laboratory exercises.}
    \label{fig:Macromorp}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, the lecture included a list of some key aspects to keep in mind while looking at the macro-morphological characteristics colonies. These are:
\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tecture (mucoid, viscous, matted, coherent etc.)
        \item Color
        \item Size
        \item Surface (glistening, smooth, verrucose, rough etc.)
        \item Elevation
        \item Margin (entire, rhizoid etc.)
        \item Mycelium (x100 magnification)
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\subsection{Micro-morphological characteristics}
Micro-morphological characteristics are also important when identifying yeast. Some of the key aspects are listed below:

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cell form (spheroidal, ellipsoidal, ovoid, lemon-shaped, 
        elongated, triangular etc.)
        \item Cell size (length, width)
        \item Cell arrangement (pairs, aggregates)
        \item  Vegetative reproduction
        \subitem Budding (monopolar, bipolar, multilateral)
        \subitem Fission 
        \item Mycelium
        \subitem Pseudomycelium (not distint septa)
        \subitem True mycelium (distint septa)
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\subsection{Assimilation and fermentation}
Assimilation refers to the process by which an organisms takes in and incorporates nutrients from the environment. The assimilation of carbon compounds is important for the growth of yeast. Yeast assimilates carbon compounds by various pathways, like Krebs cycle (TCA pathway) or the glycolysis.

Fermentation is the process by which yeast converts sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. The fermentation of carbohydrates typically happens under anaerobic conditions. The fermentation process is a less efficient energy source than respiration. Nevertheless, without it, wine and beer could not be made. Brewers therefore exploit the yeasts fermentative capability by introducing yeast into an anaerobic environment. 

\subsubsection*{Assimilation of carbon compounds}
To propagate yeast while having assimilation in mind, the growth medium  Yeast Nitrogen Base from "Difco" can be used. This medium contains:

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{multicols}{3}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Hexoses

    \end{multicols}
\end{highlight}

        techniques 
        \item Yeasts are currently mostly identified by sequencing of the D1/D2 region of 
        the 26S rRNA gene – however, never forget to verify by examining 
        morphology and include phenotypic tests
        \item Remember to consult the newest scientific literature in order to use up

\section{09.09.24 - Taxonomy and the species concept}

\subsection{Lecture content}

During this lecture the following topics will be the focus point.

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Definitions of taxonomy and phylogeny
        \item Phylogeny
        \item Microbial taxonomy: from domain to species
        \subitem Species concept in Bacteria
        \subitem Species concept in Yeast and Moulds
        \item Subspecies, variant and strains
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\subsection{Taxonomy and phylogeny}
From figure \ref*{fig:TaxDiff} we can see that the common ancestor of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota is the root of the tree, and the branches of the three domains is what sums up the tree. 
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.72\textwidth]{Figures/TaxonomyDiff.png}
    \caption{The comon ancestor of Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota and the som of their respective branches}    \label{fig:TaxDiff}
\end{figure}

A definition \textbf{Taxonomy}, this the naming and classification of organisms based on shared properties, which can be based on

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Genotypic properties
        \item phenotypic properties
        \item Phylogeny - evolutionary relationships
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

While working with taxonomy and phylogeny in a broder sense, some of the following terms are important to know:

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Isolation:} The separation of a pure culture from a mixed culture
        \subitem \textbf{Sampling:} The collection of a representative part of a population
        \subitem \textbf{Colony purification:} The isolation of a single colony from a mixed culture
        \subitem \textbf{DNA extraction:} The isolation of DNA from a pure culture
        \item \textbf{Identification:} The determination of the taxonomic position of an organism
        \subitem \textbf{Microscopy:} The determination of the morphology of an organism through a microscope
        \subitem \textbf{Sequencing:} The determination of the sequence of a gene or a genome
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

While looking at the phylogeny we can look deeper into the classification, in table \ref*{tab:ClassificationPhylogeny} we can see an example of the classification of a Bacteria and Eukarya where we stop at species. This can be further divided into subspecies, variant and strains.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{An example of the classification of a Bacteria and Eukarya}
    \label{tab:ClassificationPhylogeny}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
        Domain & Bacteria & Eukarya \\
        Kingdom & None assigned & Fungi \\
        Phylym & Firmicutes & Ascomycota \\
        Class & Bacilli & Saccharomycetes \\
        Order & Lactobacillales & Saccharomycetales \\
        Family & Lactobacillaceae & Saccharomycetaceae \\
        Genus & \textit{Lactobacillus} & \textit{Saccharomyces} \\
        Species & \textit{L. acidophilus} & \textit{S. cerevisiae} \\
    \end{tabular}    
\end{table}

In the following table, there will be listed some differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes}
    \label{tab:DiffProkEuk}
    \begin{tabular}{c|l|l}

        \hline
        \textbf{Average size} & Smaller (~1-5 $\mu$m) & Larger (~10-100 $\mu$m) \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Gram-positive \& -negative bacteria}
(Almost) all bacteria can be divided into two groups, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The difference between the two groups is the cell wall. The cell wall protects the bacteria e.g against osmotic stress. The cell wall differs where the Gram-positive bacteria have a thick cell wall, while the Gram-negative bacteria have a thin cell wall. The difference in the cell wall is due to the peptidoglycan layer, which is thicker in the Gram-positive bacteria than in the Gram-negative bacteria. The peptidoglycan layer is also the reason why the Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant to antibiotics than the Gram-negative bacteria. Here are some bulletpoints of the two groups:

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Gram-positive bacteria} 
        \subitem Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)
        \subitem Bacillus
        \item \textbf{Gram-negative bacteria}
        \subitem Most Acetic Acid Bacteria (AAB)    
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\subsection{Differentiating between bacterial species}
There are several methods to differentiate between bacterial species, some of the most common methods are:

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{DNA:DNA hybridization (DDH)}: 
        \subitem The DNA of two organisms is mixed and the degree of hybridization is measured. 
        \subitem If DDH > 70\% the organisms are considered to belong to the same species
        \item \textbf{16S rRNA gene sequencing}:
        \subitem The 16S rRNA gene is sequenced and compared to a database, if the sequence is > 97.5-98.5\%

\section{16.09 - From 1\texorpdfstring{\textsuperscript{st}}{st} to 3\texorpdfstring{\textsuperscript{rd}}{rd} generation DNA sequencing strategies}

DNA is quite small, 2 nm thick. Though, if folded out, the DNA would be around 1.8 m long. 


\subsection{Sanger Sequencing of DNA 1\texorpdfstring{\textsuperscript{st}}{st} generation sequencing}

\textcolor{blue}{5'- TACAACTGAGCGACT -3'}

3'- ATGTTGACTCGCTGA -5'

Here we have a blue sequence and a black complimenting sequence. If we want to sequence the blue sequence, we can use the black sequence as a primer. The primer will bind to the blue sequence, and the DNA polymerase will start to build a new strand of DNA. The DNA polymerase will build the new strand by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of the primer. The nucleotides are added in a 5' to 3' direction. The DNA polymerase will continue to add nucleotides until it reaches the end of the DNA strand. The DNA polymerase will then stop, and we will have a new strand of DNA. 

Though with the Sanger sequencing, we will have a mix of DNA strands, where each strand will end with a different nucleotide. The DNA strands will then be separated by size, and the sequence can be read by the size of the DNA strands.

With Sanger sequencing, the -A, -C, -G and -T nucleotides will cut the DNA strand at different lengths, because it cuts at the respective letter. An example of how the Sanger sequencing works can be seen in figure \ref{fig:SangerSequencing}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/SangerExample.png}
    \caption{An example of how the method of Sanger sequencing of DNA works with the given blue sequence}
    \label{fig:SangerSequencing}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Next generation sequencing}
Next generation sequencing (NGS), has been evolving a lot since extensive research started in the 90's. Today we have a lot of different NGS methods, one of the most common methods is the Illumina sequencing. The Illumina sequencing is based on the Sanger sequencing, but with a few modifications. Their HiSeqX can sequence around 50 human genomes in a day with a cost sub 1000 USD/genome.

\subsubsection{Sequencing by synthesis}
The Illumina sequencing is based on the sequencing by synthesis. It needs a primer, but these a fairly simple to make. 
After the primer has been added, the DNA polymerase will start to build a new strand of DNA. The DNA polymerase will add nucleotides from -A, -T, -G, anc -C, to the 3' end of the primer, and the nucleotides will be added in a 5' to 3' direction. The DNA polymerase will continue the flashing with nuclouetides until it reaches the end of the DNA strand. The DNA polymerase will then stop, and we will have a new strand of DNA. 

The maximum read out length of the Illumina is between 75 bp to 350 bp, but the average read length is around 150 bp.

\subsubsection{Bridge amplification}
A piece of DNA is attached to a glass slide, and the DNA is then amplified. The DNA is then denatured, and the DNA is then amplified again. The DNA is then denatured again, and the DNA is then amplified again. This process is repeated until the DNA is amplified enough. The DNA is then sequenced, and the sequence is read by the computer. This method grows exponentially like PCR, though the DNA is amplified in a half circle, and not in a straight line.

An example of how the Illumina bridge amplification works can be seen in figure \ref{fig:BridgeAmpl}.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \begin{subfigure}{0.35\textwidth}

\end{figure}

\subsection{3\texorpdfstring{\textsuperscript{rd}}{rd} generation sequencing}
Third-generation sequencing detects nucleotide sequences by measuring changes in ion flow across a membrane as molecules pass through a nanopore. Each nucleotide creates a distinct current profile, enabling identification of both type and sequence order \cite*{L5-HighThroughput}.
