\subsection{Article 1 - Fermented Foods as Experimentally
Tractable Microbial Ecosystems}
\subsubsection*{Introduction}
The study of microbial communities faces significant challenges, largely due to their complexity and the difficulty in understanding how these multi-species communities are assembled, organized, and function. As a result, many aspects of microbial ecology remain unexplored.

The article highlights that the vast diversity and complexity of microbial communities are key factors contributing to our limited understanding. Additionally, the difficulty in isolating the majority of species from natural environments and cultivating them in vitro presents another notable challenge \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.

One approach to addressing these challenges is the development of simplified and controlled environments to study microbial communities. These controlled systems allow for reproducible results through measurable substrates, microbial growth, and community formation \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.

Several models with these properties have already been developed. These range from synthetic mixtures of microbial strains to more complex models composed of culture-able strains from free-living or host-associated communities, as well as naturally occurring communities that have been extensively sampled or perturbed in situ \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.

\subsubsection*{Fermented Foods as Experimentally Tractable
Ecosystems}

Fermented foods have been around for thousands of years and are an excellent example of how humans have optimized conditions to promote various properties of foods. Here are some of the main reasons why fermented foods have been produced for so long \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}:
\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Good preserving effects
    \item Flavour can be improved
    \item Aroma can be enhanced
    \item Texture can be changed
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

Some factors for manipulating microbial growth are listed below \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}:
\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Temperature
    \item Salinity
    \item Moisture
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

\vspace*{1em}
The article describes some micorbial communities of fermented foods (MCoFFs) and some examples of these, which will be listed bellow \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}:
\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Multi-species biofilms associated with surfaces 
    \subitem e.g. cheese rinds
    \vspace*{0.5em}

    \item Suspended biofilms in liquid
    \subitem e.g. kombucha, kefir, and vinegar
    \vspace*{0.5em}

    \item Dispersed growth in liquid
    \subitem e.g. lambic beers, natural wines, and yogurt
    \vspace*{0.5em}

    \item Semi-solid substrates
    \subitem e.g. kimchi and miso
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

Many MCoFFs have been studied in detail, and the article highlights that some of these communities have been shown to have bacterial- and fungi species that have co-evolved over time. The microbial diversity within and across fermented foods is vast, and the article emphasizes that these communities are excellent models for studying microbial ecology. In the article, cheese rind (the MCoFFs on the surface of the cheese) was used as an example of the characterization and development of MCoFFs, since on the surface of cheese the microbial communities form as it ages \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.

\subsubsection*{Using Fermented Foods to Link Patterns, Processes, and Mechanisms of Microbial Community Assembly}

In order to understand how species come together to form a community within a given environment microbiologists have developed several approaches for both plant- and animal communities. The ones named in the article is listed below \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}: 

\begin{highlight}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Dispersal}
        \subitem Contributions from the amount and timing of microbial propagules colonizing a habitat
        \vspace*{0.3em}

        \item \textbf{Biotic selection}
        \subitem Interactions between species
        \vspace*{0.3em}

        \item \textbf{Abiotic selection}
        \subitem Interactions between a species and the environment
        \vspace*{0.3em}

        \item \textbf{Drift}
        \subitem Stochastic (random) changes in the relative abundances of species within communities
        \vspace*{0.3em}

        \item \textbf{Diversification}
        \subitem Evolution of new species within communities
    \end{itemize}
\end{highlight}

MCoFFs are ideal for linking microbial patterns with ecological processes. For instance, many fermented foods exhibit clear microbial successions where early colonizers are replaced by other species. This process can be studied to understand how environmental changes and species interactions drive these transitions. New techniques like RNA sequencing and transposon mutagenesis have proven valuable in uncovering the molecular mechanisms behind these interactions. Additionally, tools like imaging mass spectrometry are enhancing our understanding of how microbial species communicate chemically \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.

\subsubsection*{Taste of Place? Microbial Biogeography of Fermented Foods}

Though there are many different types of MCoFFs, many share some similarities. If a similar MCoFFs is used in two different cheese factories in two different locations, the microbial communities will be different, and with some distinct properties which can affect the texture, taste or aroma composition of the final product. This also enables the study of microbial biogeography, which is the study of how microbial communities are distributed across different locations. MCoFFs can therefore help linking patterns in microbial diversity from place to place. This is possible because each community has clear species abundance distributions \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.

\subsubsection*{Microbial Evolution in a Community Context}

MCoFFs offer valuable systems for studying both ecological processes and microbial evolution. Microorganisms used in beer, wine, dairy, and sake production have been useful in understanding how microbes adapt to fermentation environments. Research suggests that these organisms often lose genes not needed in nutrient-rich settings, gain new traits through gene transfer, and adjust their metabolism to fit the fermentation niche \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}. 

Looking ahead, linking ecological and evolutionary processes could provide further insights. For example, studying long-term microbial communities could help explore how species interactions influence evolution. Experimentally testing coevolution within these communities could offer useful data on microbial adaptation over time \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.

\subsubsection*{Translation to Other Microbial Communities and Potential Applications}
The study of microbial community assembly in traditional fermented foods (MCoFFs) can significantly enhance food quality and safety. Insights from these ecosystems can be applied to other microbial communities, such as the human microbiome. For example, the competitive mechanisms of \textit{Lactobacillus reuteri}, found in both sourdough and human gut microbiomes, illustrate how patterns observed in MCoFFs can be relevant to other systems \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.

Research on cheese rind microbial diversity has revealed similarities with the human skin microbiome, suggesting that moisture is a major driver of surface biofilms in both environments. This indicates that ecological selection processes may be conserved across different microbial communities \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.

MCoFFs can directly impact human health as they are consumed and can interact with the human gut microbiome. While the probiotic effects of simplified MCoFFs like yogurt have been extensively studied, the broader microbial diversity in MCoFFs could introduce additional beneficial microbes and metabolites to the human digestive system. Studies have shown that MCoFFs can remain viable during passage through the human digestive tract \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.

Furthermore, MCoFFs offer valuable opportunities for designing synthetic microbial communities for applications in medicine, industry, and agriculture. Understanding the interactions within these communities can inform the construction of synthetic microbial ecosystems. By studying pre-existing MCoFFs, researchers can learn about design principles and explore the potential for combining microbes from different MCoFFs into new, functional compositions \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}. 

Ultimately, research on food microbial communities could result in safer, more delicious foods and contribute to the development of essential principles for microbial community design \cite*{L1-FermentedFoods}.


\subsection{Article 2 - Diversity of Microorganisms in Global Fermented Foods and Beverages}

\subsubsection*{Introduction}
The article describes how rice with fermented and non-fermented legumes is a staple diet in many counties in Asia. Wheat/barley-based breads/loaves followed bt milk and fermented milk products, meat and fermented meats are more common in the western world (West Asia, Europe and North America). The staple diet in Africa and South America comprise of sorghum and maize with wild legume seeds, meat and milk products \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}. 
Consortia of microorganisms are found naturally in uncooked plant and animal materials, utensils, food containers, earthen pots and in general in the environment. When producing fermented foods, it is normal to introduce a starter culture, which contains functional microorganisms \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}. The microorganisms in fermented food has converted the chemical composition of the raw food, which results in a change in the nutritional value of the food, making it more enriched \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

\subsubsection*{Microorganisms in fermented foods}

\textbf{Lactic acid bacteria (LAB)} are one of the most important groups of microorganisms in fermented foods. They are used in the production of fermented foods and beverages. Some of the major genra of the LAB are listed below \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}:

\subsubsection*{Taxonomic tools for identification of microorganisms from fermented foods}

A commonly used method for profiling both culturable and non-culturable microbial populations from fermented foods is DNA extraction. The technique is based on the separation of PCR-amplified DNA fragments by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). This method is both used for profiling bacterial populations and yeast populations in fermented foods. Also, in fermented foods a combination of Propidium MonoAzide (PMA) treatment, which is done before DNA-extraction, and molecular quantifying methods can be used to enumerate the viable microorganisms accurately \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.
Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) is a typing method based on the genomic DNA fragment profiles amplified by rep-PCR, and is commonly used for differentiation of LAB strains from fermented foods and other bacteria or yeast in the consortia. This technique is able to differentiate between strains of the same species \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.
Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) is another technique which is used to identify and discriminate LAB strains. The technique is based on the selective amplification and separation of genomic restriction fragments \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

DGGE techniques and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) are used to study the microbial diversity in fermented foods. The techniques are based on the separation of PCR-amplified 16s rDNA and 26s rDNA gene fragments by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The techniques are used to study the microbial diversity in fermented foods. DGGE is quite time consuming and is not able to determine relative abundance of the dominant species, nor is it able to distinguish between viable and non-viable cells \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) are effective tools for studying the microbial diversity in fermented foods. The techniques are able to sequence all the genetic material present in a sample, providing a comprehensive view of the microbial community's diversity and functional potential. These techniques require extensive training and a well-equipped molecular laboratory \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

In table \ref{tab:NGS_techniques} some of the NGS which is listed in the text are described. These NGS are used to study the microbial diversity in fermented foods \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

\subsubsection{Global fermented foods}
A study reported approximately 3500 fermented food- and beverages, which were divided into 250 categories. Globally, fermented foods arae classified into 9 groups based of the substrates used from the plant- or animal source. These groups are listed in table \ref*{tab:Major_groups} \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{The 9 groups of fermented foods and beverages}
    \label{tab:Major_groups}
    \begin{tabular}{c|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{0.5\textwidth}}
        \textbf{Number} & \textbf{Group} \\
        \hline
        1 & Fermented cereals \\
        2 & Fermented vegetables and bamboo shoots \\
        3 & Fermented legumes \\
        4 & Fermented roots/tubers \\
        5 & Fermented milk products \\
        6 & Fermented and preserved meat products \\
        7 & Fermented, dried and smoked fish products \\
        8 & Miscellaneous fermented products \\
        9 & Alcoholic beverages \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Fermented milk products}
Fermented milk products can be classified into two main groups based on the microorganisms involved; Lactic fermentation and Fungal-lactic fermentations. The lactic fermentation is dominated by Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), including thermophilic- (e.g., yogurt, Bulgarian buttermilk), probiotic-  (e.g., acidophilus milk, bifidus milk), and mesophilic types  (e.g., natural fermented milk, cultured milk, cultured cream, cultured buttermilk). The Fungal-lactic fermentations involves cooperation between LAB and yeasts to produce products like alcoholic milks and moldy milks \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

Natural fermentation is an ancient method of milk processing that uses raw or boiled milk to ferment spontaneously. Starter cultures are used to initiate fermentation and can be either primary or secondary. The primary cultures mostly consist of \textit{Lactococcus lactis}, \textit{Lactobacillus delbrueckii}, and \textit{Streptococcus thermophilus}, which participate in acidification. The secondary cultures are used in cheese-making and include \textit{Brevibacterium linens}, \textit{Propionibacterium freudenreichii}, and \textit{Penicillium camemberti}, which develop flavor and texture during ripening \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

Non-Starter Lactic Acid Bacteria (NSLAB) are present in high numbers in fermented milk and include \textit{Enterococcus durans}, \textit{Lactobacillus casei}, and \textit{Staphylococcus} spp \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

\subsubsection*{Fermented cereal foods}

Fermented cereal foods are prepared differently in various regions of the world. In Asia, rice is fermented to produce alcoholic beverages or food beverages using mixed cultures. In Europe, America, and Australia, cereals like wheat, rye, barley, and maize are fermented using natural fermentation or commercial baker's yeast. In Africa, fermented cereal foods are used as staples, complementary, and weaning foods for infants and young children \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.
In Europe, traditional methods of bread preparation are still practiced without using commercial baker's yeast. Yeasts and LAB conduct dough fermentation, resulting in sourdough breads with higher lactic acid and acetic acid content \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.
Some LAB as \textit{Enterococcus}, \textit{Lactococcus}, \textit{Lactobacillus}, \textit{Leuconostoc}, \textit{Pediococcus}, \textit{Streptococcus}, and \textit{Weissella} are deeply involved in cereal fermentation. Also some yeasts have a significant role such as the strains of \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} are the principal yeast, but other non-\textit{Saccharomyces} yeasts like \textit{Candida}, \textit{Debaryomyces}, and \textit{Hansenula} is also found in cereal fermentation \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

\subsubsection*{Fermented vegetable foods}
Many vegetables such as leafy greens, radish, cucumbers, and young edible bamboo shoots, are perishable and sesasonal, therefore they are traditionally fermented into edible products to ensure longer shelflife and safe consumption \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}. The main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of vegetables are LAB, which are responsible for the acidification of the product. The most common LAB in fermented vegetables are \textit{Lactobacillus} and \textit{Pediococcus}, followed by \textit{Leuconostoc}, \textit{Weissella}, \textit{Tetragenococcus}, and \textit{Lactococcus} \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.
Some examples of fermented vegetable products are listed below in table \ref*{tab:Fermented_vegetables} \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}:

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Examples of fermented vegetable products}
    \label{tab:Fermented_vegetables}
    \begin{tabular}{c|>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{0.5\textwidth}}

        \hline
        Kimchi & A Korean fermented vegetable product, with a characterized microbial profile of LAB \\
        Sauerkraut & A German fermented cabbage product, with a reported species of LAB \\
        Gundurk & have a native population of LAB. Made by fermenting leafy greans which then sun dried to create a sour and slightly bitter flavor \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Fermented soybeans and other legumes}
There are two types of fermented soybean foods, bacillus-fermented and mould-fermented. The bacillus-fermented foods are fermented by \textit{Bacillus} spp. (mostly \textit{B. subtilis}), and are characterized by stickiness. The mould-fermented foods are fermented by filamentous molds, mostly \textit{Aspergillus}, \textit{Mucor}, and \textit{Rhizopus}.

These types of foods are concentrated in the "Kinema-Natto-Thua Nao (KNT)-triangle" region, which includes Japan, east Nepal, north-east India, and northern Thailand. Examples of bacillus-, mould-, and other fermented foods are listed in table \ref*{tab:fermented_soybean} \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

\subsubsection*{Fermented meat products}
Overall, fermented meat products are divided into two categories, whole meat pieces (e.g. jamón serrano) and chopped meat pieces (e.g. chorizo). The main microbial groups invovled in fermenting meats are LAB, coagulase-negative cocci, and yeasts. The LAB are responsible for the acidification of the meat, while the coagulase-negative cocci are responsible for the ripening of the meat. The yeasts are responsible for the development of the flavor and aroma of the meat \cite*{L1-DiversityMicro}.

\subsubsection*{Fermented fish products}
Traditionally fish is preserved by either fermentation, sun/smoke drying
and salting. Both bacteria and yeasts have been reported from these preservation methods.

\subsection{Article 3 - Molecular biology of the cell; chapter 6}

\subsubsection*{In this chapter}
In this chapter of the book, the following topics will be further described:

\textbf{The central dogma of molecular biology};
The discovery of the structure of DNA in the 1950s has led to significant progress in cell and molecular biology. We now know the complete genome sequences for thousands of organisms, including humans and our extinct relatives, such as the Neanderthals. The flow of genetic information in cells is from DNA to RNA to protein, a principle known as the central dogma of molecular biology \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{Variations in the central dogma};
While the central dogma is universal, there are important variations between organisms in the way information flows from DNA to protein. In eukaryotic cells, RNA transcripts are subject to processing steps in the nucleus, including RNA splicing, before they are translated into protein \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{The role of RNA};
RNA plays a crucial role in the cell, not only as a template for protein synthesis but also as a structural and catalytic molecule. Some RNAs fold into precise three-dimensional structures, while others act as regulators of gene expression \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{The complexity of genomes};
The genomes of most multicellular organisms are surprisingly disorderly, reflecting their chaotic evolutionary histories. Genes are often arranged in a long string of alternating short exons and long introns, with small bits of DNA sequence that code for protein interspersed with large blocks of seemingly meaningless DNA \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{Decoding genomes};
Decoding genomes is a complex task, even with the aid of powerful computers. Cells in our body can automatically locate the beginning and end of genes and decipher when and where each gene is expressed, but researchers still face significant challenges in understanding how genomes are decoded and used \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{The challenges of cell biology};
Despite significant progress in cell and molecular biology, there is still much to be discovered about how the information stored in an organism's genome produces even the simplest unicellular bacterium, let alone how it directs the development of a human with approximately 30,000 genes. The next generation of cell biologists will face many fascinating challenges in understanding the complexities of genomes and how they are decoded and used \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\subsubsection*{From DNA to RNA}
\textbf{Transcription and translation} are the means by which cells read out, or express, the genetic instructions in their genes \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{Regulation of gene expression} is when the cells can synthesize a large amount of protein from a gene when necessary, and genes can be transcribed and translated with different efficiencies, allowing the cell to make vast quantities of some proteins and tiny amounts of others \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\subsubsection*{RNA molecules are single-stranded}
\textbf{Transcription} is the first step a cell takes in reading out a needed part of its genetic instructions is to copy a particular portion of its DNA nucleotide sequence—a gene—into an RNA nucleotide sequence \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{RNA structure} is a linear polymer made of four different types of nucleotide subunits linked together by phosphodiester bonds. It differs from DNA chemically in two respects: it contains the sugar ribose and the base uracil (U) instead of thymine (T) \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{RNA folding} is single-stranded and can fold up into a particular shape, allowing some RNA molecules to have precise structural and catalytic functions \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\subsubsection*{Transcription produces RNA complementary to one strand of DNA}
\textbf{Transcription process} begins with the opening and unwinding of a small portion of the DNA double helix to expose the bases on each DNA strand. One of the two strands of the DNA double helix then acts as a template for the synthesis of an RNA molecule \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{RNA synthesis} happens when nucleotide sequence of the RNA chain is determined by the complementary base-pairing between incoming nucleotides and the DNA template. The RNA chain is elongated one nucleotide at a time, and it has a nucleotide sequence that is exactly complementary to the strand of DNA used as the template \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{Differs from DNA replication} in several crucial ways. Unlike a newly formed DNA strand, the RNA strand does not remain hydrogen-bonded to the DNA template strand. Instead, the RNA chain is displaced and the DNA helix re-forms, releasing the RNA molecules as single strands \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\subsubsection*{RNA polymerase carry out transcription}
\textbf{RNA polymerases} are enzymes that perform transcription. They catalyze the formation of the phosphodiester bonds that link the nucleotides together to form a linear chain \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{Mechanism of RNA polymerase} involves the RNA polymerase moving stepwise along the DNA, unwinding the DNA helix just ahead of the active site for polymerization to expose a new region of the template strand for complementary base-pairing, and extending the growing RNA chain by one nucleotide at a time in the 5'-to-3' direction \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{Characteristics of RNA polymerase} include the ability to start an RNA chain without a primer, being absolutely processive, and having a modest proofreading mechanism to correct errors in the growing RNA chain \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{Comparison with DNA polymerase} reveals that RNA polymerase is less accurate, with an error rate of about one mistake for every 10\textsuperscript{4} nucleotides copied into RNA, despite catalyzing essentially the same chemical reaction as DNA polymerase \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\subsubsection*{RNA polymerase binds to DNA at specific sites}
\textbf{Types of RNA} include messenger RNA (mRNA), which directs the synthesis of proteins, and noncoding RNAs, which do not code for protein and serve as enzymatic, structural, and regulatory components \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{Functions of noncoding RNAs} include directing the splicing of pre-mRNA to form mRNA, forming the core of ribosomes, and serving as adaptors that select amino acids and hold them in place on a ribosome for incorporation into protein\cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{Transcription units} are segments of DNA that are transcribed into RNA. In eukaryotes, a transcription unit typically carries the information of just one gene, while in bacteria, a set of adjacent genes is often transcribed as a unit \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.

\textbf{RNA composition in cells} reveals that RNA makes up a few percent of a cell's dry weight, with most of the RNA being rRNA, and mRNA comprising only 3–5\% of the total RNA in a typical mammalian cell \cite*{L1-Chapter6}.
