\section{Regarding the Curriculum}
The questions asked will cover the course curriculum in general. Be aware that we specifically expect you to be able to describe the principles behind molecular methodologies for identification (species) and typing (subspecies/strain) of both pro- and eukaryotes.  

\section{Guideline for exam questions}
You need to prepare for all of the 13 exam questions before the exam. You are allowed to use notes when presenting the exam question and to bring printed versions of your lab group slides. It is up to you to organize the oral presentation (no power point or shared screen are allowed). We recommend that you prepare keywords, and practice what you want to say based on the keywords. Emphasize the points you find most relevant and would like to discuss. Please notice, that it is not allowed to read aloud from a written text.  

The grade will primarily reflect the your ability to analyze and discuss the exam question and other topics related to the curriculum. 

\section{Exam Questions}

\subsection{AAB}
\subsubsection*{Question}
Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) are important in several food and biotechnological processes. Define AAB and name the most important AAB relevant to food. Describe at least two food processes where AAB play an essential role and explain their functions in these products/processes.

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{AAB}
AAB belong to the family \textit{Acetobacteraceae} and are primarily Gram-negative, with a few Gram-variable exceptions. They are obligate aerobes that require oxygen for growth and are capable of oxidizing ethanol into acetic acid, a key trait in food and biotechnological processes.

\subsubsubsection*{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gram-negative, ellipsoid to rod-shaped.
    \item Catalase positive, oxidase negative.
    \item Mesophilic, with optimal growth between 25-30\textdegree C, though some species can tolerate higher temperatures.
    \item pH optimum is between 5-6.5, though some AAB can grow at pH as low as 3.
    \item Oxidize sugars and alcohols to organic acids, primarily ethanol to acetic acid (\textit{Asaia} spp. being the exception, as it does not oxidize ethanol).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Notable genera} 
\textit{Acetobacter} (found in sugar-rich environments) and \textit{Gluconobacter} (found in alcohol-rich environments).

\subsubsubsection*{Classification}
AAB are classified as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phylum: \textit{Proteobacteria}
    \item Class: \textit{Alpha Proteobacteria}
    \item Family: \textit{Acetobacteraceae}
    \item Genera: \textit{Acetobacter}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsubsection*{Phenotypical characteristics differentiations}
Here are some common characteristics that can be used to differentiate AAB from each other:
\begin{table}[h]

            \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ll} % Adjust this value as needed
                \multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Characteristics}} \\
                \hline
                Flagellation & Oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid \\
                Oxidation of acetic acid to CO\textsubscript{2} and H\textsubscript{2}O & Growth on 0.35\% acetic acid-containing medium \\

                DNA base composition [mol\% G+C] \\
            \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsubsection*{Identification}
Identification of AAB can be done using phenotypic tests, which are tedious and difficult to perform. Therefore many prefer to use molecular biology-based tests instead. PCR-RFLP-analysis, Rep-PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, MALDI-TOF, MLSA, and full genome sequencing are some of the methods used for identification.

\subsubsubsection*{Cultivation}
Cultivation of AAB is quite difficult, they often occur in environments where especially LAB and yeast also thrive starting a war of environment domination. There are various growth mediums that can be used to isolate AAB, such as  acetic acid-ethanol (AE) or malt extract-yeast extract-acetic acid(MYA).

The AAB should be incubated for 3-6 days at temperatures between 25-30\textdegree C. The colonies will appear as small, round, and convex with a smooth surface. They are usually white, cream, or yellow in color.

\subsubsubsection*{Technological properties}
AAB oxidises ethanol to acetic acid, which is a key trait in vinegar production. This exothermal reaction is carried out by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which is present in the periplasmic space of the AAB ($\text{ethanol} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{acetic acid} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$). The acetic acid produced can be further oxidized to $\text{CO}_2$ and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ by some species, e.g. \textit{acetobacter} spp., \textit{acidomonas} spp., and \textit{gluconacetobacter} spp., which over-oxidises the acetic acid.
Futhermore, some strains of AAB can oxidise alcohols into sugars, e.g. mannitol into fructose. 

\textit{Gluconobacter} is industrially important and it produces \textsubscript{L}-sorbose from \textsubscript{D}-sorbitol, \textsubscript{D}-gluconic acid, 5-keto- and 2-keto-\textsubscript{D}-gluconate from \textsubscript{D}-glucose, and di-hydroxyacetone from glycerol.

\subsubsubsection*{Fermented foods}
Some examples of fermented foods where AAB play an essential role are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vinegar
    \subitem Generally \textit{Acetobacter pasteurianus}, but also other species
    \item Coffee
    \subitem Role unknown
    \item Cocoa
    \subitem Microbial succession
    \item Lambic
    \item Kombucha
    \subitem Cellulose layer
    \item Some sourdoughs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AAB}
\subsubsection*{Question}
Name at least one suitable substrate for isolation of AAB and explain the selective and/or indicative principle(s) behind the substrate. Name at least three phenotypic features of AAB that can be used to differentiate AAB from other microorganisms (LAB, yeasts) occasionally growing on AAB-selective substrates. Give an overview of methods that can be used to identify the different isolates to species level. 

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{Suitable substrate for isolation of AAB:}
"There are various growth mediums that can be used to isolate AAB, such as acetic acid-ethanol (AE) or malt extract-yeast extract-acetic acid (MYA)."
This is on page 138(main).
GYC - Glucose Yeast Calcium Carbonate Agar is also a suitable substrate for isolation of AAB. (Niclas)

A suitable substrate for yeast isolation mentioned is "MYGP (Malt Yeast Glucose Peptone) agar," which is used for isolating yeasts from products like apple cider. However, the document does not specify a substrate exclusively for Acetic Acid Bacteria (AAB). This information is found on page 21(LabProto).

A suitable substrate for the isolation of Acetic Acid Bacteria (AAB) is malt extract-yeast extract-acetic acid (MYA) medium, which selectively supports the growth of AAB due to their ability to grow in the presence of acetic acid while inhibiting other bacteria and yeasts (main) 

\subsubsubsection*{Selective and/or indicative principles behind the substrate}
"The acetic acid-ethanol medium (AE) is selective because acetic acid bacteria (AAB) can oxidize ethanol into acetic acid, a key trait of these organisms. The presence of ethanol and acetic acid in the medium inhibits the growth of many other microorganisms, including lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts, while promoting the growth of AAB."
This is also on page 138(main).

MYGP medium is supplemented with antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline) to prevent bacterial growth, thus allowing for selective isolation of yeasts. This medium may indirectly help in isolating AAB, as they can resist lower pH environments. This is detailed on page 23(LabProto).

\subsubsubsection*{Phenotypic features of AAB that can be used to differentiate AAB from other microorganisms}
"AAB are Gram-negative."
"They are obligate aerobes."
"They oxidize ethanol to acetic acid."
"Some strains can oxidize acetic acid further to $CO_2$ and $H_2O$."
"They grow on 0.35\% acetic acid-containing medium."
This is also on page 138(main).

While AAB are not directly mentioned, LAB are described as catalase-negative, which is one feature that helps differentiate LAB from other bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria are differentiated through a Gram test, and colony morphology descriptions are provided for yeast identification. This information is found on pages 30-32(LabProto).

\subsubsubsection*{Methods to identify different isolates to species level}
"AAB identification often relies on molecular biology techniques due to the tedious nature of phenotypic tests. Methods such as PCR-RFLP analysis, rep-PCR (often using (GTG)5), and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene or its internal transcribed spacer are commonly used. Other techniques include MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA), which provide more precise identification of AAB species."
This information can be found on page 22(main).

"Rep-PCR/(GTG)5 fingerprinting" is used for grouping and tentative identification, generating species-specific patterns that can be analyzed through software such as Bionumerics (page 10) (LabProto).

Sequencing of 16S rRNA (for bacteria) and 26S rRNA (for yeasts) is used for species-level identification. The PCR process and sequencing are described on pages 13-15 (LabProto).

Molecular techniques like BLAST searching are applied for further species identification based on sequence data, as outlined on page 16 (LabProto).

\subsection{Yeast}
\subsubsection*{Question}
Give 2-3 examples on foods and/or beverages that are fermented by yeasts. Explain whether single or multiple species participate in the fermentation and whether the yeast(s) are added as starter culture(s) or occur spontaneously. Describe the functions of the yeasts in the products. Explain how yeast can be identified to species level and give examples of typing techniques for strain characterization. 

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{Examples of foods and beverages fermented by yeasts}
\textbf{Wine}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Yeast Participation: Wine fermentation typically involves multiple species, with \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} being the predominant yeast used as a starter culture. However, non-\textit{Saccharomyces} yeasts such as \textit{Hanseniaspora}, \textit{Pichia}, and \textit{Brettanomyces} can also contribute to fermentation, especially in spontaneous fermentations \cite*{L9-ISAPP}.
    \item Functions: Yeasts convert sugars from grapes into alcohol and carbon dioxide, while also producing various metabolites that contribute to the wine's flavour, aroma, and mouthfeel \cite*{L6-Yeasts,L9-ISAPP}.
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{0.5em}
\textbf{Beer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Yeast Participation: Similar to wine, beer is predominantly fermented by \textit{Saccharomyces pastorianus} or \textit{S. cerevisiae}, depending on the beer style (lager or ale, respectively). Multiple species may be involved in spontaneous fermentation, including \textit{Brettanomyces} and \textit{Lactobacillus} \cite*{L6-Yeasts, L9-ISAPP}.
    \item Functions: Yeasts in beer fermentation are responsible for converting fermentable sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide, and they also produce compounds that enhance the beer's aroma and flavour profile \cite*{L6-Yeasts, L9-ISAPP}.
\end{itemize}

\vspace*{0.5em}
\textbf{Sourdough Bread}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Yeast Participation: Sourdough fermentation involves a complex community of microorganisms, primarily \textit{Saccharomyces exiguus} and \textit{Candida milleri}, alongside lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts may originate spontaneously from the environment or be introduced through starter cultures \cite*{L6-Yeasts}.
    \item Functions: In sourdough, yeasts ferment sugars to produce carbon dioxide, which leavens the bread, while lactic acid bacteria produce lactic acid, contributing to the sour flavour .
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Identification of yeasts to species level}
Yeast species can be identified through various methods, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Morphological Identification}: Traditional methods involve observing the size, shape, and reproduction modes (budding, fission) under a microscope \cite*{L6-Yeasts,L9-Coryn}.
    \item \textbf{Biochemical Tests}: Metabolic tests that assess the yeast's ability to ferment sugars or produce specific enzymes can help distinguish between species \cite*{L6-Yeasts,L9-Coryn}.
    \item \textbf{Molecular Techniques}: PCR amplification of specific genes (e.g., ITS region, 26S rRNA) followed by sequencing provides accurate identification. Additionally, molecular typing techniques such as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) are used for strain characterization \cite*{L9-ISAPP,L6-Yeasts}.
    \item \textbf{Phenotypic Methods}: Techniques like the API 20C kit can determine yeast species based on fermentation and assimilation patterns of various substrates \cite*{L6-Yeasts}.
    \item \textbf{Genomic Methods}: Whole-genome sequencing can provide detailed information on the genetic makeup of yeasts, aiding in species identification and strain characterization \cite*{L9-ISAPP}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Yeast}
\subsubsection*{Question}
Describe the micro- and macromorphological characteristics of the species \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} and explain how this species differs genetically from \textit{Saccharomyces pastorianus}. Give examples on food and/or beverages that favor the growth of \textit{Saccharomyces} spp. and mention potential yeast interactions with other types of microorganisms. 

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{Micro- and macromorphological characteristics of \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Micro-morphological characteristics}: \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} cells are typically globose to ovoid, measuring approximately 5 to 10 $\mu$m in diameter. They reproduce asexually by budding, where daughter cells form as small protrusions on the surface of the parent cell \cite*{LabManual}.
    \item \textbf{Macro-morphological characteristics}: On solid media, \textit{S. cerevisiae} forms creamy to white colonies, which can be smooth and glistening or slightly dull, depending on growth conditions. The colony size can vary from pinpoint (<1 mm) to larger sizes (>4 mm) \cite*{LabManual}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Genetic differences between \textit{S. cerevisiae} and \textit{S. pastorianus}}
\textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} and \textit{Saccharomyces pastorianus} differ primarily in their genetic makeup, particularly in their adaptability to fermentation conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{S. cerevisiae} is predominantly used in high-temperature fermentations (e.g., ales) and exhibits high ethanol tolerance \cite*{L9-Coryn,L6-Yeasts}.
    \item \textit{S. pastorianus}, a hybrid of \textit{S. cerevisiae} and \textit{S. eubayanus}, is adapted for lager fermentation at lower temperatures and has distinct genetic variations, particularly in genes associated with cold tolerance and lagging fermentation characteristics \cite*{L9-Coryn,L6-Yeasts}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Foods and beverages favouring the growth of \textit{Saccharomyces} spp.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Wine}: \textit{S. cerevisiae} is the primary yeast used in winemaking, where the fermentation of sugars from grapes occurs in anaerobic conditions, favouring its growth and alcohol production \cite*{L9-ISAPP,L9-Coryn,LabManual}.
    \item \textbf{Beer}: In brewing, \textit{S. pastorianus} and \textit{S. cerevisiae} are both utilized, with the former favoured in lager production and the latter in ales. The presence of malt sugars provides a conducive environment for their growth \cite*{L9-ISAPP,L9-Coryn}.
    \item \textbf{Sourdough}: Sourdough employs \textit{S. exiguus} and \textit{C. milleri}, alongside \textit{S. cerevisiae}, utilizing the carbohydrates in flour under anaerobic conditions \cite*{L9-Coryn,L6-Yeasts}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Potential yeast interactions with other microorganisms}
Saccharomyces spp. often interact with various microorganisms in fermentation environments:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bacterial Interactions}: In sourdough, \textit{S. cerevisiae} interacts with LAB, such as \textit{Lactobacillus}, which not only contributes to flavour but also enhances fermentation efficiency \cite*{L9-Coryn}.
    \item Bacterial Interactions: In sourdough, \textit{S. cerevisiae} interacts with LAB, such as \textit{Lactobacillus}, which not only contributes to flavour but also enhances fermentation efficiency \cite*{LabManual}.
\end{itemize}

    \item \textit{Bacillus licheniformis}
    \item \textit{Bacillus cereus}
    \item \textit{Lysinibacillus macroides}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Desired technological properties of \textit{Bacillus} spp. and their influence on product quality}
\textbf{Proteolycity}: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Bacillus} species possess significant proteolytic activity, which aids in protein degradation during fermentation. This property enhances flavour development by releasing amino acids and peptides that contribute to the umami taste \cite*{L8-ImpQuorum}.
\end{itemize}






\subsection{LAB}
