\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{AAB}
AAB belong to the family \textit{Acetobacteraceae} and are primarily Gram-negative, with a few Gram-variable exceptions. They are obligate aerobes that require oxygen for growth and are capable of oxidizing ethanol into acetic acid, a key trait in food and biotechnological processes.

\subsubsubsection*{Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gram-negative, ellipsoid to rod-shaped.
    \item Catalase positive, oxidase negative.
    \item Mesophilic, with optimal growth between 25-30\textdegree C, though some species can tolerate higher temperatures.
    \item pH optimum is between 5-6.5, though some AAB can grow at pH as low as 3.
    \item Oxidize sugars and alcohols to organic acids, primarily ethanol to acetic acid (\textit{Asaia} spp. being the exception, as it does not oxidize ethanol).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Notable genera} 
\textit{Acetobacter} (found in sugar-rich environments) and \textit{Gluconobacter} (found in alcohol-rich environments).

\subsubsubsection*{Classification}
AAB are classified as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phylum: \textit{Proteobacteria}
    \item Class: \textit{Alpha Proteobacteria}
    \item Family: \textit{Acetobacteraceae}
    \item Genera: \textit{Acetobacter}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsubsection*{Phenotypical characteristics differentiations}
Here are some common characteristics that can be used to differentiate AAB from each other:

                DNA base composition [mol\% G+C] \\
            \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsubsection*{Identification}
Identification of AAB can be done using phenotypic tests, which are tedious and difficult to perform. Therefore many prefer to use molecular biology-based tests instead. PCR-RFLP-analysis, Rep-PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, MALDI-TOF, MLSA, and full genome sequencing are some of the methods used for identification.

\subsubsubsection*{Cultivation}
Cultivation of AAB is quite difficult, they often occur in environments where especially LAB and yeast also thrive starting a war of environment domination. There are various growth mediums that can be used to isolate AAB, such as  acetic acid-ethanol (AE) or malt extract-yeast extract-acetic acid (MYA).

The AAB should be incubated for 3-6 days at temperatures between 25-30\textdegree C. The colonies will appear as small, round, and convex with a smooth surface. They are usually white, cream, or yellow in color.

\subsubsubsection*{Technological properties}
AAB oxidises ethanol to acetic acid, which is a key trait in vinegar production. This exothermal reaction is carried out by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, which is present in the periplasmic space of the AAB ($\text{ethanol} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{acetic acid} + \text{H}_2\text{O}$). The acetic acid produced can be further oxidized to $\text{CO}_2$ and $\text{H}_2\text{O}$ by some species, e.g. \textit{acetobacter} spp., \textit{acidomonas} spp., and \textit{gluconacetobacter} spp., which over-oxidises the acetic acid.
Futhermore, some strains of AAB can oxidise alcohols into sugars, e.g. mannitol into fructose. 

\textit{Gluconobacter} is industrially important and it produces \textsubscript{L}-sorbose from \textsubscript{D}-sorbitol, \textsubscript{D}-gluconic acid, 5-keto- and 2-keto-\textsubscript{D}-gluconate from \textsubscript{D}-glucose, and di-hydroxyacetone from glycerol.

\subsubsubsection*{Fermented foods}
Some examples of fermented foods where AAB play an essential role are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vinegar
    \subitem Generally \textit{Acetobacter pasteurianus}, but also other species
    \item Coffee
    \subitem Role unknown
    \item Cocoa
    \subitem Microbial succession
    \item Lambic
    \item Kombucha
    \subitem Cellulose layer
    \item Some sourdoughs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{AAB-2}
\subsubsection*{Question}

Give an overview of methods that can be used to identify the different isolates to species level. 

\subsubsection*{Keywords}
Table \ref{tab:KW-AAB2} shows the keywords for this question and reflects the answer written in the following subsection.

        \textbf{Topic} & \textbf{Keywords} \\
        \hline
        AAB Isolation Substrates & AE, MYA, GYC, MYGP \\
        Selective Substrate Principles & Ethanol, acetic acid, inhibition of LAB and yeasts \\
        AAB Phenotypic Differentiation & Gram-negative, ethanol oxidation, obligate aerobes \\
        Species Identification Methods & CR-RFLP, rep-PCR, 16S rRNA, MALDI-TOF, MLSA \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{Suitable substrate for isolation of AAB:}
There are various growth mediums that can be used to isolate AAB, such as acetic acid-ethanol (AE) or malt extract-yeast extract-acetic acid (MYA) (main).
GYC - Glucose Yeast Calcium Carbonate Agar is also a suitable substrate for isolation of AAB. (Niclas)

A suitable substrate for yeast isolation mentioned is "MYGP (Malt Yeast Glucose Peptone) agar, which is used for isolating yeasts from products like apple cider \cite*{LabManual}.

A suitable substrate for the isolation of AAB is malt extract-yeast extract-acetic acid (MYA) medium, which selectively supports the growth of AAB due to their ability to grow in the presence of acetic acid while inhibiting other bacteria and yeasts (main) 

\subsubsubsection*{Selective and/or indicative principles behind the substrate}
The acetic acid-ethanol medium (AE) is selective because acetic acid bacteria (AAB) can oxidize ethanol into acetic acid, a key trait of these organisms. The presence of ethanol and acetic acid in the medium inhibits the growth of many other microorganisms, including LAB and yeasts, while promoting the growth of AAB.(main).

MYGP medium is supplemented with antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol, chlortetracycline) to prevent bacterial growth, thus allowing for selective isolation of yeasts. This medium may indirectly help in isolating AAB, as they can resist lower pH environments \cite*{LabManual}.

\subsubsubsection*{Phenotypic features of AAB that can be used to differentiate AAB from other microorganisms}
AAB are Gram-negative, obligate aerobes, and they oxidize ethanol to acetic acid.
Some strains can oxidize acetic acid further to $CO_2$ and $H_2O$.
They can grow on 0.35\% acetic acid-containing medium (main).

While AAB are not directly mentioned, LAB are described as catalase-negative, which is one feature that helps differentiate LAB from other bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria are differentiated through a Gram test, and colony morphology descriptions are provided for yeast identification. This information is found on pages 30-32(LabProto).

\subsubsubsection*{Methods to identify different isolates to species level}
AAB identification often relies on molecular biology techniques due to the tedious nature of phenotypic tests. Methods such as PCR-RFLP analysis, rep-PCR (often using (GTG)5), and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene or its internal transcribed spacer are commonly used. Other techniques include MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA), which provide more precise identification of AAB species (main).

Rep-PCR/(GTG)5 fingerprinting is used for grouping and tentative identification, generating species-specific patterns that can be analysed through software such as Bionumerics \cite*{LabManual}.

Sequencing of 16S rRNA (for bacteria) and 26S rRNA (for yeasts) is used for species-level identification. The PCR process and sequencing are described on \cite*{LabManual}.

Molecular techniques like BLAST searching are applied for further species identification based on sequence data, as outlined on page 16 (LabProto).

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{Strain Definition for Bacteria}
A "strain" refers to a genetic variant or subtype of a microorganism, particularly bacteria. It is defined as an isolate or a group of isolates that can be distinguished from other isolates of the same genus and species based on specific characteristics \cite*{LS08}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Strain Definition for Bacteria}:
    \subitem A strain is often identified through a combination of phenotypic (observable characteristics) and genotypic (genetic information) traits. Common phenotypic characteristics include carbohydrate fermentation profiles and protein expression profiles \cite*{LS09}.
    \subitem Genotypically, strains can be differentiated using methods such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), which may exceed 99\% for closely related strains, as well as various molecular typing techniques \cite*{LS09}.
    \item \textbf{Type and Reference Strains}:
    \subitem The term "type strain" refers to the strain on which the description of a species is based. A "reference strain" is a strain that is widely used within the scientific community and is often maintained in curated culture collections \cite*{LS09}.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Methods for Strain Typing}
Detection of LAB strains from foods can be done by using the following molecular identification and characterization methods \cite*{LS05}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sequencing}: DNA sequence analysis for typing.
    \item \textbf{ON-Rep-Seq}: Whole genome sequencing technique.
    \item \textbf{Rep-PCR}: Amplifies repetitive DNA for typing.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Principles Behind Strain Typing Methods}
This is a brief overview of the principles behind the methods used for strain typing \cite*{LS09,L3-SeqBasedClass}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sequencing}: Involves sequencing specific genes or regions of the genome to identify genetic variations between strains. The sequences are compared to reference databases to determine strain identity and are coupled with e.g. Rep-PCR.
    \item \textbf{ON-Rep-Seq$^*$}: ON-Rep-Seq is a optimized version of the rep-PCR method, that enhances the capabilities of Rep-PCR, enabling consistent DNA amplification and the simultaneous processing of many samples efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Rep-PCR$^*$}: Primers target interspersed repetitive sequences. In the lab exercises we used (GTG)5 primers for rep-PCR. No prior knowledge of the DNA sequence is needed, and it is used for initial grouping of microorganisms to reduce sequencing costs.
    \item \textbf{PFGE$^{**}$}: Switching the current facilitate separation of large DNA fragments. The DNA fragments are separated based on their size, allowing for the comparison of the banding patterns between strains.
    \item $^*$Sequencing methods, $^{**}$PCR-based methods.
\end{itemize}

        \textbf{Topic} & \textbf{Keywords} \\
        \hline
        Antimicrobial Compounds & Lactic acid, diacetyl, hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocins \\

        Inhibition Spectrum & Gram-positive, pore formation, cell death \\
        \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{Overview of Antimicrobial Compounds Produced by LAB}
LAB produce a variety of antimicrobial compounds that are key to their role in food preservation. These include lactic acid, diacetyl, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocins \cite*{L3-LAB}. Bacteriocins, in particular, are ribosomally synthesized peptides that inhibit or kill closely related bacterial strains, and are known to be heat-stable. These compounds not only contribute to competitive inhibition of spoilage organisms but also enhance the safety of fermented foods. \cite*{L3-LAB}.

\subsubsubsection*{Detection of Inhibitory Compounds}
The detection of antimicrobial compounds, such as bacteriocins, typically involves culturing LAB and testing their supernatants for antimicrobial activity against indicator strains. The use of agar diffusion assays is a common method, where zones of inhibition around the LAB cultures indicate antimicrobial activity \cite*{L3-LAB}. To specifically detect bacteriocins, the inhibitory activity is tested for sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes such as protease and $\alpha$-chymotrypsin. If the activity is lost upon enzyme treatment, this indicates the presence of a proteinaceous inhibitory compound, which could be a bacteriocin \cite*{L3-LAB}.

\subsubsubsection*{Investigating Types of Inhibitory Compounds}
To identify the type of inhibitory compound produced by LAB, different biochemical and molecular methods are used. Chromatographic techniques like HPLC, coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), can be employed to characterize the molecular structure of the inhibitory compound. Genetic analysis of LAB strains can reveal the presence of bacteriocin gene clusters, which are typically organized in operons and encode both the bacteriocin peptide and its associated immunity proteins \cite*{L3-LAB}.

\subsubsubsection*{Determining if an Inhibitory Compound is a Bacteriocin}
An inhibitory compound is classified as a bacteriocin if it meets the following criteria: it is a ribosomally synthesized peptide, it exhibits antimicrobial activity that is proteinaceous (sensitive to protease treatment), and it targets bacteria \cite*{L3-LAB}. Additionally, bacteriocins are often associated with a specific immunity system that protects the producing strain from its own bacteriocin \cite*{L3-LAB}.

\subsubsubsection*{Classification of Bacteriocins}
Bacteriocins produced by LAB are categorized into different classes based on their structure and mode of action:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class I}: Small lantibiotics, such as nisin, which contain unusual amino acids like lanthionine. These attack cell membranes and are heat-stable \cite*{L3-LAB}.
    \item \textbf{Class II}: Small, heat-stable, non-lantibiotic bacteriocins. These attack cell membranes. These include \cite*{L3-LAB}:
    \subitem \textbf{Class IIa}: Pediocin-like bacteriocins, with strong anti-listerial activity
    \subitem \textbf{Class IIb}: Two-peptide bacteriocins
    \item \textbf{Class III}: Large, heat-labile proteins \cite*{L8-MicroInFood}.
    \item \textbf{Class IV}: Complex bacteriocins with additional glyco- or lipid moieties \cite*{L8-MicroInFood}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Inhibition Spectrum and Mode of Action}
The inhibition spectrum of bacteriocins can vary. For example, nisin is effective against a broad range of Gram-positive bacteria, including \textit{Listeria monocytogenes}. The mode of action of bacteriocins typically involves binding to specific receptors on the target cell membrane, leading to pore formation and cell death \cite*{L3-LAB}. Some bacteriocins, like the lantibiotics, bind to lipid II in the bacterial cell wall, disrupting cell wall synthesis. Others, like Class IIa bacteriocins, form pores in the membrane, leading to leakage of cytoplasmic contents and eventual cell lysis \cite*{L3-LAB}.

Describe the principles behind quorum sensing (QS) and give examples of microbial properties (traits) that are under QS control. Explain how QS differs from other types of microbial interactions. Mention 2-3 types of microbial interactions which are not under QS control and explain their mode of action.  

\subsubsection*{Keywords}
Table \ref{tab:KW-Quorum} shows the keywords for this question and reflects the answer written in the following subsection.
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Keywords for Quorum Sensing} 
    \label{tab:KW-Quorum}
    \begin{tabular}{l|l}
        \textbf{Topic} & \textbf{Keywords} \\
        \hline
        Quorum Sensing (QS) & Cell-density dependant, signalling molecules, synchronized behaviour \\

        Non-QS Interactions & Nutrient competition, organic acid production, bacteriocin production \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{Principles Behind Quorum Sensing (QS)}
Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-density dependent mechanism where microorganisms communicate via signalling molecules to regulate gene expression once a critical population threshold is reached. This allows for synchronized behaviors across the microbial population \cite*{L8-ImpQuorum}.

\subsubsubsection*{Microbial Properties Under QS Control}
Microbial traits under QS control in food-related microorganisms include biofilm formation, acid stress tolerance, bacteriocin production, competence, adhesion, morphological switches, and growth orientation \cite*{L8-ImpQuorum}.

\subsubsubsection*{Differences from Other Microbial Interactions}
QS involves the production and detection of signalling molecules by microorganisms, allowing them to alter behaviour in response to cell population density. This differs from other microbial interactions like nutrient competition or production of inhibitory compounds, which do not rely on such communication mechanisms \cite*{L8-ImpQuorum}.

\subsubsubsection*{Examples of microbial interactions not under QS control}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nutrient Competition}: Microorganisms compete for limited resources such as nutrients, impacting their growth and survival in environments like fermented foods \cite*{L8-ImpQuorum}.
    \item \textbf{Production of Organic Acids}: The production of organic acids by LAB during fermentation reduces the pH, inhibiting the growth of spoilage microorganisms \cite*{L8-ImpQuorum}.
    \item \textbf{Bacteriocin Production}: Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides produced by certain bacteria, including LAB, which inhibit closely related species and contribute to food preservation \cite*{L8-ImpQuorum}.
\end{itemize}

        Mechanisms Against Diarrhea & SCFA-production, inflammatory mediators, organic acids (pathogen inhibitation) \\
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{Definition of Probiotics}
The consensus definition of probiotics is: “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” \cite*{L10-Pro_Pre}.

\subsubsubsection*{Common Probiotic Species}
These are species with claimed probiotic effect, see lecture 19 for more examples \cite*{LS19}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Lactobacillus acidophilus} (often included in fermented dairy products like yogurt).
    \item \textit{Bifidobacterium animalis} (modulates gut microbiota and supporting immune function).
    \item \textit{Saccharomyces boulardii} (particularly effective in reducing diarrhea and preventing gastrointestinal disorders).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Properties of Potential Probiotic Candidates}
Probiotic microorganisms act via a variety of means, in the following list, some propersites are listed \cite*{L10-Pro_Pre}:

    \item Interfacing with the host
    \item Improving gut barrier integrity
    \item Enzyme formation
    \item Can increase phagocytosis or natural killer cell activity and interact directly with dendritic cells
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Investigating Probiotic Properties}
Much the derived knowledge on probiotic mechanisms is found while researching animal cell cultures in vitro, or on human models ex vivo. Weather one or the other methods has been used, it is imperative that the probiotics must be extensively evaluated and shown to have positive health effects \cite*{L10-Pro_Pre,LS19}.

\subsubsubsection*{Mechanisms Against Diarrhea}
The following effects can have a positive impact on diarrhea \cite*{L10-Pro_Pre}:
\begin{itemize}

        Koji Fermentation & \textit{Aspergillus oryzae}, amylases, proteases, umami compounds, B vitamins \\
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nutrient Bioavailability}: Fermentation increases the bioavailability of vitamins and minerals. For instance, tempeh fermentation enhances vitamin $B_{12}$ production and amino acid availability by breaking down proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids, improving digestibility and nutrient absorption \cite*{LS22}.
    \item \textbf{Reduction of Anti-Nutritional Factors}: Microorganisms such as \textit{Lactiplantibacillus plantarum} degrade anti-nutritional factors like phytic acid, raffinose, and stachyose in plant-based foods. This process increases the bioavailability of minerals like calcium and iron, which are otherwise bound by these compounds \cite*{LS22}.
    \item \textbf{Production of Health-Promoting Metabolites}: LAB and other microorganisms produce beneficial metabolites such as SCFAs (e.g., butyrate which lowers blood pressure), which enhance gut health by maintaining the integrity of the gut barrier and reducing the risk of metabolic disorders \cite*{LS22,LS19}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Kimchi Fermentation}
\textbf{Pathways Involved}: Kimchi fermentation primarily involves LAB, including species such as \textit{Leuconostoc mesenteroides}, \textit{Lactobacillus plantarum}, and \textit{Lactobacillus sakei}. These microorganisms metabolize sugars into lactic acid, which lowers the pH and inhibits the growth of harmful pathogens \cite*{LS14}.

\textbf{Health benefits}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item LAB in kimchi produce lactic acid, which creates an acidic environment that preserves the food and promotes gut health \cite*{LS14}
    \item Fermentation enhances the bioavailability of certain nutrients, including B vitamins, which are important for overall metabolic health \cite*{LS19}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Cacao Fermentation}
\textbf{Pathways Involved}: Cacaos successive fermentation is driven by yeasts, LAB, and AAB. Yeasts ferment sugars into ethanol, followed by LAB converting sugars and organic acids into lactic acid, and finally AAB oxidize ethanol into acetic acid, which contributes to flavour development \cite*{ORM_1}.

\textbf{Health benefits}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fermentation enhances the levels of bioactive compounds such as flavonoids and polyphenols, which have antioxidant properties and can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases \cite*{ORM_1}.
    \item The high content of monomeric (epicatechin and catechin) and oligomeric (procyanidins) flavanols has through studies shown positive health benefits \cite*{ORM_1}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Koji Fermentation}
\textbf{Pathways Involved}: Koji fermentation involves the mould \textit{Aspergillus oryzae}, which produces enzymes like amylases and proteases that break down starches into sugars and proteins into amino acids. This saccharification process is essential for producing products like miso, soy sauce, and sake \cite*{LS11}.

\textbf{Health benefits}:
Koji fermentation enhances the digestibility of proteins and produces umami compounds such as glutamate, which contribute to flavour and increased nutrient absorption aids in the production of vitamins, such as vitamin $B_2$ and $B_{12}$, which are essential for maintaining energy levels and neurological health \cite*{LS11}.

    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Answer}
\subsubsubsection*{Culture-Independent Techniques}
Culture-independent methods bypass the need for growing microorganisms in a lab. These techniques include high-throughput sequencing (HTS), such as 16S rRNA sequencing, which allows for the identification of bacterial species directly from environmental samples by analysing their genetic material.

\textbf{Advantages}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item They allow for the detection of both culture-able and non-culture-able organisms, which is especially useful in complex microbial communities such as fermented foods \cite*{L3-SeqBasedClass,L5-HighThroughput}.
    \item Faster results compared to culture-dependent methods, as they do not require incubation periods \cite*{L5-DNAEnrichment}.
    \item Provide insights into the diversity and structure of microbial communities through sequencing techniques such as 16S rRNA sequencing \cite*{L3-SeqBasedClass}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Does not offer functional data about the microorganisms, such as metabolic activity \cite*{L5-HighThroughput,L3-SeqBasedClass}.
    \item Some techniques (e.g., 16S rRNA sequencing) may not resolve closely related species \cite*{L5-HighThroughput}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Culture-Dependent Techniques}
Culture-dependent methods involve the isolation and cultivation of microorganisms on specific media before further testing. These methods are essential for obtaining live cultures for functional and strain-level analyses.

\textbf{Advantages}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allow for more detailed studies of bacterial phenotypes and strain-specific characteristics, especially when combined with techniques such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) \cite*{L5-DNAEnrichment}
    \item Enable researchers to conduct functional assays, such as antibiotic resistance testing or metabolic profiling, on live cultures \cite*{L3-SeqBasedClass}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited to organisms that can grow under specific lab conditions, excluding non-culture-able organisms \cite*{L5-HighThroughput}.
    \item Time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires the incubation of individual colonies on culture-specific media \cite*{L5-DNAEnrichment}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsubsection*{Nanopore Amplicon Sequencing for Species Identification}
Nanopore amplicon sequencing is a culture-independent technique which provides real time sequencing of long DNA fragments. Moreover, Nanopore allows the user to identify species and strains without the need for fluorescence chemistry. 
Nanopores are small holes created by proteins. The Nanopore sequencing principles is detection by the generated current of the nucleotide which passes through the Nanopore. The changes in the current are characteristic of a particular nucleotide base \cite*{LS10,L3-SeqBasedClass}.

\textbf{Examples of Applications}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nanopore sequencing can be applied for the identification of \textit{Salmonella enterica} at the strain level using repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (Rep-PCR) coupled with ON-rep-seq \cite*{L5-DNAEnrichment}.
    \item Nanopore sequencing can also be applied to rapidly sequence the 16S rRNA gene from mixed microbial samples, allowing species identification in fermented food samples \cite*{L3-SeqBasedClass}.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsubsection*{Amplicon Sequencing vs. Whole Genome Sequencing}
\textbf{Advantages of Amplicon Sequencing}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Long-read sequencing allows for the identification of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences, providing more accurate species identification compared to short-read sequencing \cite*{LS10}.
    \item Fast runtime allows for multiple runs in a short amount of time \cite*{LS10}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Higher error rates (38\% in 2015, 5\% in 2016) compared to short-read sequencing technologies like Illumina (1\%) \cite*{LS10}.
    \item Limited to specific genomic regions, making it less informative for strain-level differentiation and functional genomics compared to whole-genome sequencing \cite*{L5-DNAEnrichment}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages of Whole Genome Sequencing}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provides comprehensive genomic information, including strain-level differences, gene content, and functional pathways \cite*{L5-DNAEnrichment}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Disadvantages of Whole Genome Sequencing}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item More expensive and computationally demanding than amplicon sequencing \cite*{L5-DNAEnrichment,L3-SeqBasedClass}.
\end{itemize}
